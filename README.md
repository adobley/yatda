# YATDA

## Praise for YATDA

It sucks, so help us make it better.

# Getting Started

1. Get Node/NPM, I use NVM to manage it
2. Clone repo
3. Run `npm install` in the project folder, it should create a typings folder
4. Open a terminal window and type `npm start` to run the app and get live changes synced to the browser
5. Open another terminal window and type `gradle bootRun`. Because Aidan.

`npm test` will start up a test server to run tests against Chrome with a file watcher.

If you don't have IntelliJ Enterprise I recommend VSCode with TSLint and Angular 2 TypeScript Snippets

There are other good plugins too but those are pretty basic solid support.

## What to do next?

Open an issue with the brilliant author for the errors that you see in the console.

## And after that?

Well, you're on your own.
